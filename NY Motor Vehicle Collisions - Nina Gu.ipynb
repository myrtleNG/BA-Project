    "This notebook focuses on the analysis of New York City's vehicular collision data, which is publicly available on the official New York City Open Data platform at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95. The dataset contains information about motor vehicle crashes that occurred within the city.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehending the dynamics of motor vehicle collisions is crucial for promoting public safety and providing essential information for policy decisions. The dataset offers a comprehensive overview of vehicular accidents, capturing detailed information such as date, time, location, contributing factors, and outcomes. This analysis aims to extract valuable insights from the data, serving policymakers, law enforcement, and the public. The goal is to foster a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing motor vehicle incidents, ultimately reducing accident occurrences and enhancing road safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains information from all police-reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The information for this dataset is collated from the police report, called MV104-AN, which is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is available from 2012-07-01 onwards, however for this analysis, we will limit ourselves to the period up to 2023-08-15, which is when the data was downloaded.\n",
    "We find that this data contains over 2 million observations, which allows us to explore several aspects of vehicle crashes in NY's boroughs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data dictionary for the data is also available at the URL above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and visualization tools, we aim to uncover insights into the factors contributing to collisions, identify high-risk areas, and provide valuable information for policymakers, law enforcement, and the general public. The analysis will be conducted using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we perform unstructured exploration of the data, and then try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We relate the number of crashes to shethe borough's population to find out which borough has the maximum number of crashes for every 100,000 people. Even though the data does not have this information, we can combine the crash data with the population estimates for the boroughs also available from the City of New York's website (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Population-by-Borough-1950-2040/xywu-7bv9)\n",

    "- Analyze the data to find the borough with the second-highest total number of crashes since 2012.\n",
    "- Identify the leading cause of crashes, excluding cases where the contributing factor is 'Unspecified', and calculate the proportion of accidents attributable to this cause.\n",
    "- Determine the top 5 causes of crashes (excluding 'Unspecified') and calculate the proportion of total crashes caused by these top 5 factors.\n",
    "- Analyze the dataset to determine the total number of accidents reported since 2012 where the incident resulted in two or more fatalities.\n",
    "- Conduct an analysis to determine the average fatality rate per 1000 accidents, showcasing how frequently at least one person succumbs to injuries in the dataset.\n",
    "- Perform an analysis to calculate the proportion of accidents within the dataset that lack information on the Cross Street Name.\n",
    "- Identify the combination of vehicles (represented by 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 1' and 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 2') with the most number of accidents.\n",
    "- Among alcohol-related crashes, calculate the proportion that resulted in a fatality.\n",
    "- Calculate the proportion of crashes that occur during the evening rush hour (4 PM to 7 PM).\n",
    "- Among motorcycle crashes, calculate the proportion that resulted in injuries but no fatalities.\n",
    "- Analyze the dataset to calculate the total number of crashes involving bicycles as one of the vehicles, providing insights into the frequency of such incidents.\n",
