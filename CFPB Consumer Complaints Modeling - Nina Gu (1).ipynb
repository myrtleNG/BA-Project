    "This notebook focuses on the analysis of financial complaints data provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is publicly available on the CFPB's official website at https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/. The dataset contains information about consumer complaints filed against financial companies and banks.\n",

    "Comprehending the dynamics of consumer complaints is crucial for understanding customer experiences and optimizing operational costs for financial institutions. The dataset offers a comprehensive overview of complaints, capturing detailed information such as date, company involved, complaint details, and outcomes. This analysis aims to extract valuable insights from the data, serving financial institutions and policymakers. The goal is to identify patterns and factors that contribute to complaint disputes, ultimately reducing operational costs and improving customer satisfaction.\n",

    "The original dataset contains over 2 million recent records covering 6000+ financial providers. For this analysis, we will focus on data up to 2017 and specifically consider complaints related to the top 5 banks in the US. The dataset used for this project can be found in the JupyterHub shared folder (complaints_25Nov21.csv).\n",

    "The cost structure associated with managing complaints is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It costs banks one hundred dollars on average to resolve and close a complaint that is not disputed. \n",
    "If a resolution is disputed by the customer, it costs an additional five hundred dollars to resolve the complaint (making the total cost six hundred dollars).\n",
    "To minimize costs and optimize complaint resolution, banks can perform \"extra diligence\" at an additional cost of $90 per complaint to prevent disputes. However, this cost is only justified if the complaint is likely to be disputed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to develop a model that can predict which complaints are likely to be disputed, allowing banks to proactively perform extra diligence on those complaints to reduce overall costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging predictive modeling techniques and data analysis, we aim to identify key indicators and patterns that can help predict dispute likelihood, thereby enabling banks to optimize their response strategies and minimize operational expenses."
